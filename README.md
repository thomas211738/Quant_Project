# Machine Learning on Technical Analysis Indicators
This project was created by @thomas211738 and @joshleeds

## Overview
We wanted to see if technical analysis indicators were good predictors of a stock's future directionality. Since there are many technical analysis indicators, we decided to use as many as possible and apply them as features to a neural network to identify the best combination of technical analysis indicators that result in the best results. We did this for about 230 stocks to test how well the models worked for different stocks and avoid overfitting our 

## Technical Analysis Indicators
For this project, we used the following technical analysis indicators as features:

Simple Moving Average (SMA)
Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
Relative Strength Index (RSI)
Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
Bollinger Bands
Stochastic Oscillator
Ichimoku Cloud Signals
Aroon Indicator
Williams %R
